	<br><br><p>October 10, 2016<br>Assembled raspberry pi and installation of its os. Camera module installation and testing on raspberry pi.
	</p><br><p>Current progress</p><br>Last tuesday (October 4,2016) I submitted the required files for printing my PCB in prototype lab.
	Hopefully to start soldering this week if I get my PCB today.
	<br><p>Problems and Opportunities</p>Problem- vibration sensors<br>-Will have to start researching on how to installl
	and code sensors into raspberry pi. Can possibly get some help with people in engineering club.
	<br><p>Financial updates<br>Sensors,raspberry pi and camera module prices can be viewed in budget report. Every materials
	used are in budget so far. Will probably need some metal sheets for testing the sensors to demo as a car door which will probably cost 10-30 
	dollars depending on the size of the material.</p>
